# weather-app
This is a app that will display weather when you enter a city name 
i used a api for weather to get the information needed to display the weekly condiotions for city.
i can see the values in console log but cant seem to see them when they transfer it only shows object so i still working on that.
but elements for already searched cities are generated when city is searched and objects display. currently only supports most popular cities in midmest but will expand
